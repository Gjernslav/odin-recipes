This desert is not only delicous but it is also very quick and easy to set up and make. The joy of a no-bake desert is that you can make it anytime and the flavor is so good you can always have one on hand if you needed!</p>
        
    <p>One thing to note, if you are not familiar with galletas Maria/Maria cookies. They are a type of sweet biscuit widely consumed in Europe and Latin America. They have the perfect consistency where they can be soaked in liquid without crumbling or falling apart. They are also very budget friendly. You can find galletas maria in the international aisle of most grocery stores or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Goya-Maria-Cookies-Jumbo-Ounce/dp/B09G4SXRNT/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=galletas+maria&qid=1696216055&sr=8-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online.</a>

        <li>1 1/2 Cup sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1 1/2 Cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 Cup unsweetened natural cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup milk (divide)</li>
        <li>1/2 Teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>7oz Maria cookies</li>
        <li><strong>Optional</strong>1/2 Cup dark chocolate for drizzling (melted)</li>
        <li><strong>Optional</strong>1 1/3 Cups slivered almonds (crushed)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Step One: Make the chocolate cream</strong> Using either a hand or stand micer, beat the butter and salt until creamy on medium-high speed, about 10-15 minutes.   <strong>Note:</strong> Beating the butter for a long time is what adds air and makes if fluffy, while aleviating the super buttery taste. Add the condensed milk slowly; mix until well incorporated, 2 minutes. Then add the powdered sugar and continue mixing untilincorporated and creamy, about 2-3 minutes. Then add the chocolate powder and mix until you have a consistent and fluffy mixture, about two more minutes. Finally, add 2 tablespoons of milk and vanilla exctract; mix to incorporate. <strong>Note:</strong> If your cream is too stiff, add 1-2 more tablespoons of milk.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Step Two: Assemble the Marquesa</strong> Line a 9-inch nonstick springform pan with parchment paper. Spread evenly 1/4 of the chocolate cream on the bottom of the mold. Plae the remaining milk in a bowl. Dip the maria cookies (2 at a time) in the milk for 2-3 secondss. <strong>Note:</strong> This is just a quick dip; don't over soak the cookies, or the cake will have a lousy texture. Place a layer of cookies on the top of the chocolate cream. Continue alrenating cream and cookies until you finish all the cookies. it will be about 4 layers. finish with cream on top. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigereate for 8 hours or overnight.</li>
       
        <li><strong>Step Three: Serving the marquesa</strong> When ready to serve, loosen the marquesa from the pan's sides by running a thin metal spatula around the inside of the rim. Unmold and transfer to a serving dish or a cake plate. If desired use the optional ingredients to decorate the marquesa. Take a handful of slivered almonds and carefully press them around the cake, then drizzle with melted chocolate. Serve. <strong>Note:</strong> I reccomend leaving the marquesa at room temprature for 5-10 minutes before serving so the cream can soften a little.</li>
